# infx-512-finalproject

This repo is to be used for Priscilla Spencer's final project in INFX 512.

For this assignment I have created a personal portfolio site.

This site is broken down into 4 pages: main page is the home page, secondary page with a few of my favorite things, third page is a link to pinterest, and the fourth page is a contact me page.
